### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

ğŸŒ± My name is Mary and I am a graduate student at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in the Weather and Climate Risk and Data Analytics Master's Program. I also work full time in Emergency Management and disaster recovery specializing in community projects and grant funding delivery in response to flooding, hurricanes, pandemics, and wildfires. 

My research focuses on leveraging big data to build predictive disaster risk models that enhance community risk assessment and anticipate evolving safety needs.
